### Hi there üëã
- I'm currently working on a side project [`avalon-chat`](https://github.com/avalon-202n).
- I like *cool architectures* with *scalability* and *object-oriented programmings*.
- I also like to organize my knowledge with an easy to read & write form.

### I'm currently learning ...
- *kotlin* with the help from „Äékotlin in action„Äè& [Jetbarin Kotlin youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@Kotlin).
- *spring boot* with the help from some lectures & my side-projects.
- *ktor* with third version of [project realworld](https://www.github.com/ndy2/realworld-ktor)
