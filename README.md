### Hi there üëã
- I'm currently working on a side project [`avalon-chat`](https://github.com/avalon-202n).
- I like *cool architectures* with *scalability* and *object-oriented programmings*.
- I also like to organize my knowledge with an easy to read & write form.

### I'm currently learning ...
- *kotlin* with the help from „Äékotlin in action„Äè& [Jetbarin Kotlin youtube].(https://www.youtube.com/@Kotlin)
- *spring boot* with the help from some lectures & my side-projects.
  
### My Archive
- [Haha-Blog](https://ndy2.github.io/Haha-Blog/)
- is my archive where I record my learning histories.
- I hope my writing skill gets better. T.T
